# 🧭 Analytics Capability Matrix

**Website:** [https://jtabz.github.io/analytics-capability-matrix/](https://jtabz.github.io/analytics-capability-matrix/)

## 📖 What Is This?

The **Analytics Capability Matrix** is a diagnostic and discovery tool for sales teams (AEs and SEs). 

It moves the customer conversation away from generic "BI features" and toward specific **organizational maturity**. Instead of asking "Do you need a dashboard?", this tool helps you identify where a customer sits on the spectrum of analytics sophistication—from basic reporting to AI-driven automation.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

The primary goal is **accurate diagnosis**. You cannot prescribe the right solution (or sell the premium value) if you don't understand the customer's current capabilities.

* **For Discovery:** Use it to map out exactly what the customer is doing today versus where they want to go.
* **For Gap Analysis:** Visually highlight the "missing links" in their strategy (e.g., "You have great dashboards, but no data governance—that is why your adoption is low").
* **For Upsell:** Justify why they need advanced features (like Data Cloud or Tableau Pulse) by showing the specific capability unlock they provide.

## 🧩 How It Works

The matrix likely breaks down analytics maturity into key dimensions. While tailored for conversation, it typically follows a structure similar to:

### The 4 Stages of Maturity
1.  **Descriptive (Hindsight):** "What happened?" (Static Reports, Excel)
2.  **Diagnostic (Insight):** "Why did it happen?" (Interactive Dashboards, Drill-downs)
3.  **Predictive (Foresight):** "What will happen?" (Trends, Forecasting)
4.  **Prescriptive (Action):** "How can we make it happen?" (AI Agents, Automated Workflows)

### Core Dimensions
* **Technology:** The tools they own vs. what they need.
* **Data Strategy:** How they handle cleanliness, security, and modeling.
* **People/Process:** The skills of their team and their culture of adoption.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

* **Account Executives:** To qualify deals. If a customer is stuck in "Stage 1," selling them a "Stage 4" AI vision without a roadmap will fail.
* **Solution Engineers:** To scope the Proof of Concept (POC). If they lack basic data capabilities, the demo must focus on *ease of data prep* before showing flashy AI.
* **Customer Success:** To build a "Success Plan" that moves the client up the ladder over time.

## 🚀 Usage Strategy

**"Don't sell the feature. Sell the move to the next box."**
